# KendraMillsPhotography-

We have created a website for one of our partners in this project who is just now starting her photography business. 

The target market and objective for this website is for any family, friend group, or businesses who need a photographer in our community or surrounding communities. Our purpose for the website is to showcase Kendra's photography and allow future clients to contact her easier.

Website:

We have included some very challenging code for the website. We have placed a slide show for our home page. This homepage also includes a button. All of this was made with HTML and CSS. We learned some of this code through Nick Pettit(treehouse) and also through w3schools and stackoverflow. This was a fun yet very challenging part of this project due to our school's schedule and not having much time.

When you click the button, it will open to the gallery. This showcases Kendraâ€™s previous projects. This was just uploading photos and adding the code to our html and sizing it with html.

Our next link we established is the calendar. This is full of html and css. We still have stuff we would like to do with this including making it interactive through javascript where clicking a date would allow you to fill a form out with secured contact info where Kendra could contact you and confirm the reservation. We are also working on making a full year calendar instead of only one month. 

Our next link we have created is the about page. This is simply getting to know more about the photographer, Kendra, and why she enjoys photography. 

Our last page is a contact page. We have linked all of our social medias. We have also included an email and a phone number for any contact inquiries. 

This website was hard at first, but thanks to mostly w3schools, we have learned a lot about development and coding. We have worked very hard for this project to give you the best of our abilities that we have learned through our coding and web development class. We all really enjoyed the challenge of the Dev Catalyst project.
